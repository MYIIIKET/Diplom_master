% Please download the codes for Greedy Gradient Max-Cut (GGMC), Gaussian Random Field (GRF), 
% Local and Global Consistency (LGC) methods at website:
% http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~jebara/code.html
% Select the "Semi-Supervised Learning Using Greedy Max-Cut CODE"
% Uncompress the downloaded file and include it in your path of matlab. 
% Together with the released codes, one can make preliminary comparisons.

% I have to remove dijkstra.mexw64 because it cannot be uploaded to 
% the matlab exchange system. I replaced dijkstra.mexw64 with dijkstra.cpp
% So you can compile it yourself. A really slow implementation using 
% matlab programming language is also provided, dijkstra.m
% However, dijkstra.m is very slow and not recommended. 

% The codes may take several hours for each demo
% Run "Demo_Coil20.m";"Demo_CBCL.m";"Demo_mnist04data.m"
% The parameters can be changed.
